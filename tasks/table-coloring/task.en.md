# Table coloring

The page contains a table built up of several empty `td` elements. Each of the elements has a `data-color` attribute, that stores the color to which we wish to change the cell's background to, after the user clicks on the element. If the `td` gets clicked on, change the background color to the appropriate color (that is different for all of the elements)! You can assume that all `color` attributes are valid hexadecimal colors.

### Notes to teachers

The three solutions aren't three steps, but rather three gradually more general solutions. The `delegate` function used in the third solution might seem complex. Details of the smart delegation can be found in the [5.30 chapter](http://webprogramozas.inf.elte.hu/tananyag/kliens/#esemenyek-buborekolasa-es-delegalasa) of the Hungarian class material.
