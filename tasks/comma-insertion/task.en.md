## Comma insertion

A sentence's meaning can be dramatically changed by commas, semicolons and dots. Create a page where the provided sentence is show in the following way: each space is replaced by a dropdown list (`select`), where the user can choose whether they whish to insert a comma, semicolon or dot between the two adjacent words! Don't forget to provide an option to insert them at the end of the sentence!

### Additional tasks

- After selecting the desired punctuation mark, the user should be able to press a button that will print the sentence to plain text.
- Change the button to append the new sentence at the end of a list instead of writing the older text over, thus preserving previously generated sentences.
