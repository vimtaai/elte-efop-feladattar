## Filter settlements

An array of settlements is given, and we'd like to list them using a filter. Crate a page, where a user can type into a search bar (`input`), and after pressing a button, you list every settlement that includes the filter in their names.

### Additional tasks

- Make the program case-insensitive (capital letters should not matter)!
- Remove the search button, and make it so that after every new letter the settlements are listed again.

### Examples (including both additional task)

- `am` ➡ Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Offenbach am Main, Potsdam
- `ber` ➡ Bergish Gladbach, Berlin, Heidelberg, Lutherstadt Wittenberg, Nürnberg
- `berg` ➡ Bergish Gladbach, Heidelberg, Lutherstadt Wittenberg, Nürnberg
- `enb` ➡ Lutherstadt Wittenberg, Offenbach am Main, Oldenburg

### Notes to teachers

The boilerplate code contains an array with Hungarian settlements, and an array with German settlements. It is wise to use the German version for international students, because it may be more understandable.
