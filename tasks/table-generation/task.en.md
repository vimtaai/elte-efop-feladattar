## Table generation

Write a JavaScript program that lists an existing dataset (animals of a farm) into a well structured table, given the user presses a button. The table should contain the header even after the rows were inserted!

### Additional tasks

- Each animal has a field that contains a boolean (whether given animal is indoor or not; `indoor`). If its value is `true`, the respective column should contain the text `Indoor`, while on a `false` value it should be `Outdoor`!
- If an animal is younger than 5 years old, its row should be colored blue, and red otherwise (use the `.young` and `.old` classes)!
- Only list the data once, after that any button press should do nothing.

### Notes to teachers

- The original data mustn't change in the process!
- The three solutions aren't three steps, but rather three different ideas, relying on more and more complex JavaScript features.
