## Details and summary

Your task is to create a site, where `.details` elements have their larger chunk of text (`.text`) hidden, while only the summary (`.summary`) is visible. If the user clicks on the element, show the longer text, then on another click, hide it yet again.

### Additional tasks

- Solve the task assuming that there can be several `.details` elements, each with their own `.summary` and `.text` children!
- Solve the task for several `.deatils` by only creating a single event listener!

### Notes to teachers

The `delegate` function used in the third task might seem complex. Details of the smart delegation can be found in the [5.30 chapter](http://webprogramozas.inf.elte.hu/tananyag/kliens/#esemenyek-buborekolasa-es-delegalasa) of the Hungarian class material.
