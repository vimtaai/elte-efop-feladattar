## Learning Card

There are given English-Spanish word translations. For the start there should be card with a random English word. Clicking on the card it "turns" and should show the Spanish translation to the English word. Clicking again turns the card back. There is also a button that gives us the next random card - with English side up.

### Additional tasks
